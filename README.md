country search app with React;
I create an app with using react router axios and react hooks. You can search any country with a search-bar input. You can alsa click any country name and see some information about that country. The main aim in this project to show how to use lifting state up property. That is why two states (search and countries) are located in App Component, which is the parent component of others. Other Components are CountryList Country and Search.
